# Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition Text Adventure #

A text-based adventure using a single-page React app. Enemy stats are pulled from https://www.dnd5eapi.co/, and used in the game logic to determine how combat will play out.

As a child, I often played text-based adventures, and, separately, Dungeons and Dragons. I wanted to combine two of my favorite childhood activities into something that can be easily accessible and updated.
